## Introduction

Lidar technology plays a crucial role in various fields, including gaming, mapping, and robotics. This project aims to integrate lidar capabilities into a Unity environment, creating a unique experience for users. The implementation uses particle systems to visualize point clouds generated by the lidar scanner.

## Features

- **Particle System Visualization**: Visualize lidar data using Unity's particle system.
- **Real-time Scanning**: Experience real-time data capture and rendering.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust settings to fit your specific needs.
- **Easy Setup**: Follow simple steps to get started quickly.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umardarazkhan/lidar-unity.git
   cd lidar-unity
   ```

2. **Open in Unity**:
   Launch Unity Hub and open the cloned project. Ensure you are using Unity 6 or higher.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Check the `Assets/Plugins` folder for any required plugins. Follow the instructions provided in each plugin's documentation.

4. **Download Releases**:
   For the latest version of the project, [download the releases here](https://github.com/umardarazkhan/lidar-unity/releases). Execute the downloaded file to set up the latest features and fixes.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the lidar scanner in your Unity project. Here's how:

1. **Open the Scene**:
   Navigate to `Assets/Scenes` and open the main scene.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   Click the Play button in Unity to start the lidar simulation. You should see particles representing the scanned data.

3. **Adjust Settings**:
   Use the Inspector to tweak the parameters such as particle size, density, and scanning speed.

4. **Explore the Code**:
   Feel free to dive into the code located in the `Assets/Scripts` folder. This is where the main functionality resides.

## Code Structure

The project is organized into several key folders:

- **Assets**: Contains all project assets, including scenes, scripts, and materials.
- **Scripts**: Houses the main C# scripts responsible for lidar functionality.
- **Prefabs**: Includes reusable game objects, such as particle systems and UI elements.
- **Scenes**: Contains Unity scenes for testing and demonstration.

### Key Scripts

- **LidarScanner.cs**: Manages the scanning process and data collection.
- **ParticleManager.cs**: Handles particle generation and rendering.
- **UIController.cs**: Manages user interface elements for interaction.
